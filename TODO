* Add sentry crash reporting.
  X configure sentry
  X mention sentry in README
  X add text to start page
  X pass release version to sentry init method
  X upload source markup
  X clickable sentry link on start screen
  X configure context with browser details etc.  
  X upload source code
  X github integration  
  X breadcrumbs
  X https://docs.sentry.io/workflow/releases/?platform=browsernpm#associate-commits-with-a-release
  X notify sentry after release created
    X configure a sentry environment.

  - adding "react-game@" prefix to sentry release name has stopped it working out which commits are in the release.
  - backtraces are minified when come from android tablet.
  - CSP reports
  - connect client and server sessions
  - feedback page
  - more environments?

* Why does ball move inside the magnet?
  - makes it wobble too much

* It's occasionally possible to drag magnet without having reattached the ball.

* Can UI be re-rendered in between the various saga's actions?

* finger-width border, not 5% of screen size.

* Deploy coverage report from travis to github pages.
  - coverage is measured (https://travis-ci.org/jg210/react-game)
  - detailed report is not kept

* Run flow coverage report on test server.

* Jest unit-test coverage has dropped in some areas.

* connected components have poor/no jest coverage.

* pointerevent test coverage.

* GameEngine and Magnet coverage
  - use mock renderer to avoid need for canvas implementation?

* Magnet.test.js has test cases that move Magnet but that don't check position afterwards.

* js crash (in reducer) only shown in debug console, which you might not notice.

* Indicate when points are won.
  - numbered bubbles that fade out over time.
    - when hit balls
    - extra points at end of level
    - extra points at end of game.
 
* Change ball image to something ferromagnetic.
    - https://clipartimage.com/clipart/12640-anvil-clipart.html?
  - use anvil-shaped matter.js Body
    => might need to take more care over angular momentum
  - rename js field

* Electromagnet image.

* Add cable for electromagnet?
  - http://brm.io/matter-js/demo/#chains

* Add images for objects.

* When dragging magnet, don't move centre of magnet to pointerdown coordinates.
  - record offset when start dragging

* No typescript extensions => no js formatter in VSC?

* Polish the CSS.

* Importing Foo wrapped with react-redux connect as Foo using default export is unclear.
  - it's not immediately obvious that component Foo is wrapped.

* Deploying to gh-pages creates a lot of blobs in git (e.g. node_modules)
  - deploy somewhere else?
  - uses fewer files somehow?

* Localization.

* High Score table.
  - persistence => cookies => banner.
  - persist on server?
  - make sure score can't be lost wherever exit game
    - e.g. by exiting fullscreen mode
    => update highscore every time score changes.

* Allowing negative scores looks odd.

* Find way to run npm audit on CI.

* Chrome audit.

* Offline web app?

* Different StartScreen text for mobile/desktop.

* The game's harder on larger screens.
  - scale ball and objects proportionally?

* Browser zooming interacts badly with game.
  - objects and ball can become very small
    - makes ball move slowly too.
  - or box doesn't fit on screen
  
* Refine image preloading
  - keep prefetching in StartScreen
  - add onLoad handlers that wait for images to onLoad
  - show spinner screen after StartScreen if preloading isn't complete
    - sharing prefetching markup using a Prefetch component.

* Error page says "This screen is visible only in development. It will not appear if the app crashes in production" for production builds.
