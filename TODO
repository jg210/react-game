* Ball velocity can change.
  - velocity can become high enough to allow ball to tunnel through the walls.
  - ball sticks to top of ceiling, even if drop it from lower height
  - fix min and max velocity on collision?
    - as function of bar height

* Ball can get stuck at right hand side of box.
  - kinematic not stepped control of bar position?
  - uneven roof?

* Proper matter.js coordinate calculations.

* Accelerating bar movement.
  - add impulse on key press (and damping), don't just move bar?
    - make bar collide with walls?

* Mouse-based movement of bar?

* Gravity well?

* Uneven roof?  
  - otherwise, have to use edge of bar if ball gets stuck bouncing straight up and down.

* Change favicon.ico.

* Add back publish script.
  - inject URL via env. var.

* Goal posts.

* Score keeping.

* Test server.

* TypeScript/flow.
