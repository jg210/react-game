* Implement game over toast/screen.
  - replace reducer with a saga that
    - shows screen
    - updates scores
    - waits
    - hides toast.

* Why is eslint confused by reducers' switch indentation?

* unit tests

* review redux and react-redux documentation etc. and refine implementation

* no typescript extensions => no js formatter in VSC?

* logging library.

* https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react-redux?

* Add some jest snaphshot tests.

* Ball can get stuck at sides of box or bounce up and down forever.
  - domed or triangular bar?
  - uneven roof?  
  - rely on well timed nudge as ball passing bar?
  - shake up obstacles?
  - tiltable bar?
  X invisible static bar attached to visible non-static bar with spring Constraints?
    X would look more interesting and be more skeuomorphic
    X would add a bit of randomness to ball collisions.
    X but no - it causes too much enery loss.

* kinematic, not stepped, control of bar position.

* Marked collisions leak memory.
  - remove them?
  - fade out with time?
 
* Accelerating bar movement.
  - add impulse on key press (and damping), don't just move bar?
    - no, since bar needs to be "static" for elastic collisions
  - use hidden, dynamic bar to model physics, updating position of a
    static bar on every update?

* Better UI layout.

* Change favicon.ico.

* Add back publish script.
  - inject URL via env. var.

* Test server.

* Non-rotating ball looks odd.
  - use symmetrical image?
  - very high inertia allows some rotation.
    - would need to damp the rotation somehow too.
  - could allow some friction too, for more realistic looking bounces
    - but would need to give some way of adding energy to the system.
      - flippers?

* Mouse-based movement of bar.
  - MouseConstraint?
    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-ou_sVlTWk&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6akvoNKE4GAxf6ZeBYoJ4uh&index=24
      - MouseConstraint connected to Mouse connected to canvas.elt
      - Mouse.pixelRatio = pixelDensity(); // retina displays, p5 canvas required?
      - add MouseConstraint to world.
      - bar can't be static, but bar has to be static...
      - tunnelling is likely to be a problem

* fix min and max velocity on collision?
  - as function of bar height, conserving energy

* Toggle for marked collisions?
  - connecting react to non-react JavaScript...

* Importing Foo wrapped with react-redux connect as Foo using default export is unclear.
  - it's not immediately obvious that component Foo is wrapped.
