* Score can increase by more than 1 when ball hits wall.

* Score can be zeroed even when ball doesn't hit bottom wall.
  - saw this when ball was bouncing vertically off bar right next to right wall.

* Non-rotating ball looks odd.
  - use symmetrical image?
  - very high inertia allows some rotation.
    - would need to damp the rotation somehow too.
  - could allow some friction too, for more realistic looking bounces
    - but would need to give some way of adding energy to the system.
      - flippers?

* Set keyboard focus after changing level.

* Ball can get stuck at sides of box.
  - kinematic not stepped control of bar position?
  - uneven roof?
  - rely on well timed nudge as ball passing bar?
  - other obstacles?
    => a way to increase difficulty.

* Invisible static bar attached to visible non-static bar with sprint Constraints?
  - would look more interesting and be more skeuomorphic
  - would add a bit of randomness to ball collisions.

* Mouse-based movement of bar.
  - MouseConstraint?

      - MouseConstraint connected to Mouse connected to canvas.elt
      - Mouse.pixelRatio = pixelDensity(); // retina displays, p5 canvas required?
      - add MouseConstraint to world.
      - bar can't be static, but bar has to be static...
      - tunnelling is likely to be a problem

* fix min and max velocity on collision?
  - as function of bar height, conserving energy

* Obstacles can overlap ball at startup, causing high CPU use due to many score updates.

* Obstacles can be placed inside the walls.

* Accelerating bar movement.
  - add impulse on key press (and damping), don't just move bar?
    - make bar collide with walls?

* Score can be made arbitrarily high if ball ends up boucing straight up and down.

* A ball asset that shows rotation?

* Uneven roof?  
  - otherwise, have to use edge of bar if ball gets stuck bouncing straight up and down.

* Goal posts.

* Redux.

* High score.

* Improve UI.

* TypeScript/flow.

* Change favicon.ico.

* Add back publish script.
  - inject URL via env. var.

* Test server.
